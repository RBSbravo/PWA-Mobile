## 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:

   ```bash
   cd PWA-mobile-app
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: `https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app/api`
   - `VITE_SOCKET_URL`: `https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app`

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Build the app**:

   ```bash
   cd PWA-mobile-app
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Upload `dist` folder** to Netlify
3. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard

### Option 3: Manual Server Deployment

1. **Build the app**:

   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Upload `dist` folder** to your web server
3. **Ensure HTTPS** is enabled (required for PWA)
4. **Configure environment variables**

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

### Update Railway Backend CORS

Add your PWA domain to Railway backend environment variables:

```env
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-pwa-domain.vercel.app
SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-pwa-domain.vercel.app
```

### Test Backend Connection

Test your Railway backend is accessible:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app/api/health
```

## 📱 PWA Features

### Installation

- **Chrome/Edge**: Look for install button in address bar
- **Firefox**: Menu > Install
- **Safari**: Share > Add to Home Screen
- **Mobile**: Browser menu > Add to Home Screen

### Offline Support

- App works offline after initial load
- Data syncs automatically when online
- Offline actions are queued and executed when connection is restored

### Real-time Updates

- Live task updates via WebSocket
- Push notifications for important events
- Background sync when app is not active

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] PWA installs successfully on mobile/desktop
- [ ] App works offline (disconnect internet and test)
- [ ] Real-time updates work (create task in one browser, see update in another)
- [ ] Push notifications work (grant permission and test)
- [ ] Authentication works (login/logout)
- [ ] Task management works (create, update, delete tasks)
- [ ] File uploads work
- [ ] Theme switching works

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure Railway backend allows your PWA domain
2. **Service Worker Not Working**: Check HTTPS is enabled
3. **Offline Features Not Working**: Check IndexedDB support in browser
4. **Real-time Updates Not Working**: Check WebSocket connection

### Debug Steps

1. Open browser DevTools > Application tab
2. Check Service Worker status
3. Check IndexedDB for offline data
4. Check Network tab for API calls
5. Check Console for errors

## 📊 Performance

- **Bundle Size**: ~500KB (optimized with code splitting)
- **First Load**: Fast with service worker caching
- **Offline**: Full functionality after initial load
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for instant updates

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Railway Backend** (if not already done)
2. **Deploy PWA** to Vercel/Netlify
3. **Configure CORS** on Railway backend
4. **Test all features** end-to-end
5. **Set up monitoring** and analytics
6. **Configure custom domain** (optional)

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:

- Check Railway backend logs
- Check Vercel/Netlify deployment logs
- Review browser console errors
- Test API endpoints independently
